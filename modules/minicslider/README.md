This is a free slider module for Prestashop v1.5+. Its really awesome and easy to use for everyone. In the configuration page everything is well explained so easy usage is guaranteed. 

If you have a cool idea or just want to send us a comment/feedback please don't hesitate to use the built in feature, or you can leave a comment on the official [Prestashop Forum](http://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/194690-free-module-minic-slider-for-ps-15/page__p__965180#entry965180).

We would like to build up a "kick-ass module arsenal" for Prestashop 1.5+, with awesome eye-catchy modules. If you wish to receive updates about these modules you can subscribe to our [newsletter](http://module.minic.ro/newsletter/).

#####IMPORTANT!

Transplanting the module is very easy. Below you can find the available positions and you can find more info [here](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS15/Managing+Modules+and+Themes#ManagingModulesandThemes-Movingamodulewithinahook).

This is a new topic for the minic slider module, because there will be no future development for the old versions. And due to the many comments I decided to make a new topic for the new module.

If you want to use in the TOP POSITION than the module has to be the last in that position, by default will be the last, just remember if you install a new module don't forget to change the position. Also by default the module will be visible on all of the pages (if TOP position is used), you can fix this with the option (Home only) or with the exceptions on the module transplant page.
